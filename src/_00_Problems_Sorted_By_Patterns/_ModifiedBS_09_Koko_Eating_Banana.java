/* [ _ModifiedBS_09_ ] [ Koko eating banana ]
_______________________________________________________________________________
   Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas.
    The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
   Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and
    eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and
    will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

   Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
    Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

        Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
            Output: 4

        Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
            Output: 30

        Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
            Output: 23

/*  GIVEN :  piles = [3,6,7,11]
    With this type of problems: first we need to find on what we do the binary search and whats the range
    Think what if the given hours == length of Array
      -- In this cases koko needs the speed of value of max element in array i.e. 11b/hour ..to finish all piles
      -- what if given hours is  âˆž .. in that case logical she can eat 0 banana/hr
    Use binary search to approach the correct answer.
    We have 0 = min rate and max is 11 .. so the answer is some were between 0-11, and best way to do BS for this range
     
     Time Complexity: O(NlogW), where N is the number of piles, and W is the maximum size of a pile.
     Space Complexity: O(1).
