/* [ _ModifiedBS_13_ ] [ Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets ]
_______________________________________________________________________________
    Given an integer array bloomDay, an integer m and an integer k.
    We need to make m bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use k adjacent flowers from the garden.

    The garden consists of n flowers, the ith flower will bloom in the bloomDay[i] and then can be used in exactly one bouquet.
    Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make m bouquets from the garden.
    If it is impossible to make m bouquets return -1.

    Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m (bouquets) = 3, k(adjacentFlowers) = 1
        Output: 3  ---> Let's see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower
        didn't bloom in the garden. We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.
            After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
            After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
            After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.

    Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
    Output: -1  --> We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers.
    We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.

        Given mid days, we can know which flowers blooms. Now the problem is, given an array of true and false,
