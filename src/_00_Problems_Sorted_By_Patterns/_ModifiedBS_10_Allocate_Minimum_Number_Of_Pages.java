/* [ _ModifiedBS_09_ ] [ Allocate Minimum Number Of Pages ]
_______________________________________________________________________________
    Given number of pages in n different books and m students. The books are arranged in ascending order of number of pages.
    Every student is assigned to read some consecutive books.
    The task is to assign books in such a way that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum.

    Input : pages[] = {12, 34, 67, 90}
            m = 2
    Output : 113
        suppose noOfStud = 2 then what are possibilities:   12|34+67+90 , 12+34|67+90, 12+34+67|90
                                                            12|191          46/157         113|90
                                                    max ->    191             157            113

    Of the 3 cases, Option 3 has the minimum pages = 113.

    /*
        What we learned from given explanation:
        A student have to read minimum Max pages by ready just one book of minimum page i.e 90 (when noOfStud = noOfBooks)
        Or a student have to ready all the books alone = sumOfAllBooksPages = 12+34+67+90 = 203page (when noOfStud = 1)
        The answer is between these min and max.
        Use binary search to approach the correct answer.
        As previous problem, will take midValue of (lo and hi) and see ifPossible to finish all
        book with given number of students by reading max midValue and accordingly move midValue
        
              ‚óè Time complexity: O(n * log(sum of array))
                    The binary search costs O(log(sum of array)) *
                    the time complexity is O(n) since we only need to go through the whole array.
